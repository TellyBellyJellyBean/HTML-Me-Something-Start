                     <p>When it comes to investing, the age-old adage "the early bird gets the worm" rings especially true.
                        While starting young may seem unncessary, especially with distant goals like retirement, the truth is,
                        getting an early head start can make a world of difference in your finanical future. Keep reading and researching here to find out why.</p>

                  <p>Imagine your money growing not just on its own, but also on the interest it earns. That's the power of
                     compound interest. The earlier you invest, the more time your money has to grow exponentially. Even small
                     contributions early on can snowball into a significant sum over time. Let's say you start investing $100
                     a month at 20, compared to someone who starts at 30. By retirement, the early investor could have
                     hundreds of thousands of dollars more, simply beacuse of the extra decade of growth.</p>

                  <p>Market fluctuations are inevitable. But when you're young, you have time on your side to ride out the
                     inevitable ups and downs. Short-term losses become less significant when you have a long-term horizon.
                     Early investing allows you to weather temporary dips, knowing the market has historically bounced back
                     over time. One thing that is guaranteed if you do not find a way to make your money work for you is the
                     value of your money over time will erode due to inflation. $100 invested in the S&P500 50 years ago is
                     roughly worth $500,000 today. $100 saved in a bank account from 50 years ago currently has
                     the purchasing power of about $10, which is a due to inflation and is a difficult concept to motivate one
                     to invest given the amount of time involved but still deems investing even more of a necessity.</p>

                  <p>Typically, younger individuals have fewer financial obligations and can therefore afford to take on
                     slightly more risk with their investments. This can potentially lead to higher returns compared to safer,
                     lower-growth options. As you age and your financially security becomes more crucial, you can adjust your
                     investment strategy to become more conservative.</p>
